# Project Title: Electronic Schema Viewer using WinBGIm Library

## Data of Creation
10/11/2022 - 10/12/2022

## Description
This project implements a simple electronic schema viewer using the WinBGIm graphics library. With this application, users can visualize electronic circuit diagrams and schematics in a user-friendly interface. The program allows users to load predefined schema files or create and edit their own electronic schematics using basic drawing tools provided by WinBGIm. The application aims to provide an intuitive platform for students and hobbyists to design, analyze, and understand electronic circuits visually. It offers a hands-on experience for learning electronics principles and circuit design concepts in an interactive environment.

All the graphics used are handmade, together with their corresponding implementation.

## Features

- **Saving and Loading Schemas**: Users can save their created schemas and load saved schemas for future reference and editing.
- **Multi-Language Support**: The app supports three languages: English, French, and Romanian, which users can switch between at any time.
- **Zoom and Pan Functionality**: Users can zoom in and out of schematics and move the view in any direction for detailed examination.
- **Helping Map**: A helping map can be added underneath the components to aid in better arrangement and understanding of the schema.
- **Handmade Loading Animation**: The application features a handmade loading animation accompanied by randomly selected tips to engage users during loading times.
- **Interactive Sounds**: Sounds are triggered when hovering over or clicking buttons, enhancing the user experience.
- **Custom Buttons and Components**: All buttons and components within the application are handmade, contributing to a cohesive visual experience.
- **Customizable Background Pictures**: Users can change the background pictures to suit their preferences or specific needs.
- **Predefined Color Themes**: Several predefined themes are available, which adhere to color theory principles for aesthetically pleasing and functional designs.
- **Component Rotation and Connection**: Users can rotate components and seamlessly connect them within the schema. The menu options dynamically adjust based on the component's position on the screen to prevent glitches.
- **Smart Component Connectivity**: Components are intelligently designed to connect only from predefined sides, enhancing the integrity and clarity of the schematics.
- **Advanced Connection Algorithm**: The application utilizes a combination of A* algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm to intelligently connect components, ensuring efficient and optimal routing.
- **Component Deletion**: Users can easily delete components from the schema, streamlining the editing process and allowing for iterative design improvements.
